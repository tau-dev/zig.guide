# Errors

With the infix `!` operator, you can specify a type that can hold a
regular value OR a special error value; this is called an *error union*.
The `error{...}` syntax specifies an error set, a set of possible error
values. An error union, consisting of such an error set and a wrapped
type, can then be unwrapped using the
[`catch`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#catch) operator,
which supplies a default value of the wrapped type in case the
union holds an error.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{ErrorUnion}</CodeBlock>

This is the primary error handling mechanism in Zig; because the
language philosophy is to make all possible control flow visible, there
are no stack-unwinding exceptions.

Error unions most commonly occur as return types of functions; in this
case, the actual error set of an error union may be elided and will be
inferred by combining all possible errors returned by the function. (The
Zig compiler is currently quite verbose when trying to describe such an
inferred error set, but this will improve in the future.)

The `catch` may be followed by a `|capture|` to get the particular value
from the error set:

<CodeBlock language="zig">{ErrorPayloadCapture}</CodeBlock>

Note here that instead of specifying a replacement value with the catch, we
can also decide to return early.

:::note

This is not a special rule, but follows neatly from the fact that
`return`, just like `while (true) {}`, `unreachable`, or a block
ending with a return, is an expression of the special type
[`noreturn`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#noreturn). An
expression of this type can be used in place of any other type of value,
because control flow will simply not arrive at the place that would use
the resulting value.

:::

An important pattern when no error can be handled locally would be to
bubble it up to the caller with `x catch |err| return err`. For this
purpose, Zig supplies the syntactic sugar [`try
x`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#try).

<CodeBlock language="zig">{ErrorTry}</CodeBlock>

Unlike enums, error sets are structurally typed. They coerce to their
supersets and can be merged with the `||` operator. The special type
`anyerror` is the superset of all error sets in the program.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{ErrorSetMerge}</CodeBlock>

An important difference to many other languages' error handling is
that error values hold no other payload. They are intended purely for
deciding control flow; any additional information, such as detailed
error messages, should be stored out-of band. This allows even `anyerror`
values to be stored compactly and managed simply as plain old data.


[`errdefer`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#errdefer) works like
[`defer`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#defer), but is only executed when the `errdefer`'s block is exited by returning an error.
